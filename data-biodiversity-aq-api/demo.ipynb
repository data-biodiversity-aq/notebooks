Specimens were collected in 331 different sampling stations at depths ranging from 17 to 1100 meters in the framework of 17 different Italian Antarctic expeditions funded by the Italian National Antarctic Research Program (PNRA). A total of 807 specimens, belonging to 144 morphospecies (i.e. 95 taxa identified at species level and 49 classified at least at the genus level), are included in the dataset. Nearly half (45%) of the species reported here correspond to species already known for Terra Nova Bay. Out of the remaining 55% previously unknown records, under a third (~29%) was classified at the specific level, while over a quarter (~26%) was ascribed to the genus level only and requires further study. All vouchers are permanently curated at the MNA and are available for study to the scientific community. A 3D model of an uncommon species from the Ross Sea, i.e. Tethyopsis brondstedi (Burton, 1929), is also presented here and will be made available for outreach purposes.',\n   'pubDate': '2019-03-19',\n   'intellectualRight': 'Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 License',\n   'doi': '10.15468/robcnf',\n   'alternateIdentifiers': ['10.15468/robcnf',\n    'https://ipt.biodiversity.aq/resource?r=mna_antarctic_porifera',\n    '89ed0b61-e110-4735-8774-8ac3a7fc3eb7',\n    'http://ipt.biodiversity.aq/resource?r=mna_antarctic_porifera'],\n   'boundingBox': 'SRID=4326;POLYGON ((-180 -78, -180 -70, 160 -70, 160 -78, -180 -78))',\n   'citation': 'Ghiglione C, Alvaro M C, Cecchetto M, Canese S, Downey R, Guzzi A, Mazzoli C, Piazza P, Rapp H T, Sarà A, Schiaparelli S (2019).

It is located in the circumpolar permanent pack-ice zone (Hempel 1985a), characterized by summary polynyas (areas of open water surrounded by sea ice). Due to its remoteness and persistent sea-ice cover, it was not accessible for extensive scientific surveys before the availability and support of modern research platforms that are capable to operate independently in sea-ice covered waters. \\n     First multidisciplinary marine research was carried out in this area in the 1980s during the first Antarctic cruises of the German icebreaking research and supply vessel &#34;Polarstern”. Embedded in a broad ecological research programme, addressing a range of evolutionary, systematic, zoogeographical and ecological issues, first comprehensive faunistic inventories of the asteroid (starfish), ophiuroid (brittle star) and holothurian (sea cucumber) bottom fauna were conducted, based on field sampling efforts during “Polarstern” cruises ANT-I/2 (PS01), ANT-II/04 (PS04), and ANT-III/3 (PS06) (for cruise reports see Hempel 1983, Drescher et al. 1983, Kohnen 1984, and Hempel 1985b, respectively). \\n     The major objective of this collection work was to provide material for subsequent zoogeographical and ecological studies on the asterozoan (asteroid and ophiuroids together; Voß 1988, Piepenburg et al. 1997) and holothurian fauna (Gutt 1988, Gutt 1991), as well as for analyses of entire macrozoobenthos communities (Gutt 2000; for a compilation: Gutt et al. 2013). Here, we publish the complete original dataset of asteroid, ophiuroid and holothurian abundances (and absences) that formed the basis of the scientific findings published in the research papers mentioned above, to allow for the general accessibility to such data associated with starfishes, brittle stars and sea cucumbers from the South-Eastern Weddell Sea.\\n\\nAsteroid, ophiuroid, and holothurian specimens were sampled at a total of 59 sites distributed across the South-Eastern Weddell Sea at water depths between 160 and 1,180 m (for more detailed information see section on “Geographic coverage” below). In general, this region characterized by a relatively homogenous physical environment, especially in terms of water masses, poorly sorted sediments, persistent sea-ice cover and hardly predictable occurrence of coastal polynyas. As such, it is representative for the entire high-latitude Antarctic habitat. Some drivers of faunistic heterogeneity, in addition to biological interactions and unknown unpredictable factors, are briefly summarized in the section on “Project Data - Study area description” below.\\n   The field samples were mainly taken by means of an Agassiz trawl, but also with a commercial bottom trawl and, in one case, a smaller dredge. During the cruises, GPS positions were available approximately each six hours. Between the GPS fixes, the ship&#39;s positions were death reckoned. Swept areas were estimated for each haul as described in Voß (1988) and Gutt (1988). Water depths were measured by a DWD echo sounder. For more detailed information see section on “Sampling methods - Sampling description” below. \\n     Specimens were collected from either total catches or, in some cases subsamples, counted and preserved on board. Using the swept-area estimates, individual counts were standardized to abundance values (ind m^-2). After the cruises, the preserved specimens were identified to species in the lab. Some holothurian species, which were assumed to be new to science, were formally described (Gutt 1990a, b). Some of these new descriptions were later revised. The specimens were not integrated into a museum&#39;s collection, and original data were never published at that time when electronic data bases did not yet exist.\\n     The quality of the data and metadata published here was enhanced prior to publication following the best practices suggested in the literature during the digitalization and geo-referencing processes. Moreover, the current accurate spelling of scientific names - except for the ophiuroid Theodoria conveniens (&#34;nomen dubium&#34;) - was reviewed based on the World Register of Marine Species (www.marinespecies.org/). For more information see “Sampling methods - Quality control” below.\\n\\nThe dataset comprises a total of 4,509 records of absences and abundances of 35 asteroid species (with a total of 2,089 specimens) and 38 opiuroid species (with a total of 18,484 specimens) from 34 stations, as well as of 66 holothurian species (with a total of 20,918 specimens) from 59 stations. \\n     Asteroid, ophiuroid and holothurian species were present at all sites investigated in the study area but composition and abundance of the asterozoan and holothurian assemblages varied considerably.     In the case of asterozoan patterns (Voß 1988, Piepenburg et al. 1997), water depth and latitude seemed to be the most important drivers of assemblage distribution and composition. At shallow shelf sites rare asteroid and ophiuroid predators, such as, e.g., Acodontaster conspicuus and Odontaster validus, respectively, as well as epibiotic ophiuroids, e.g., Astrotoma agassizii, occurred in addition to the common and widely distributed opportunistic feeders. In the case of holothurians (Gutt 1988, Gutt 1991), one assemblage co-occurred with the rich macrozoobenthic community dominated by dense epifauna consisting of, e.g., sponges and gorgonians, which are often used as substratum by epibiotic filter feeders. Others live mainly as vagrant deposit feeders on the predominantly non-colonised substratum, such as typical deep-sea species, e.g. Elpidia glacialis and Protelpidia murrayi (Gutt and Piepenburg 1991). In addition, a mixed holothurian assemblage was identified. \\n\\nVirtually nothing was known about echinoderms in the south-eastern Weddell Sea before the field sampling work, in the course of which the data published here have been gained. Also from other Antarctic regions only sporadic information on the three echinoderm classes, especially holothurians, was available at that time, mainly found published in the taxonomic literature. However, the application of a whole-assemblage approach was novel, and comparable surveys are even nowadays rare.\\n     The unique dataset encompasses some of the first observations of asteroids, ophiuroids and holothurians in this area and represents a significant contribution of primary data about Antarctic benthos assemblages. Moreover, it provides unique baseline data for future faunistic, ecological and conservation studies to evaluate the effects of climate change and possible future fishing activities in this area. At present and in the future these faunistic data can gain further importance in the context of a number of further applications:\\n(1) More comprehensive circumpolar analyses and comparative studies with other large taxa become possible if these data are merged with similar datasets from other regions, see e.g., http://ipt.biodiversity.aq/resource.do?r&#61;asteroidea_zoogeography and http://ipt.biodiversity.aq/resource.do?r&#61;biopearl_asteroida. Data on these three echinoderm classes can also be compared within the same region with other taxa or environmental parameters, as compiled, e.g., by De Broyer et al. (in press). \\n(2) At the time of sampling in the 1980s, the study area was almost pristine and hardly affected by any anthropogenic activities. In the meantime, exploratory fishing started on the deeper shelf, and the knowledge on the fauna before the onset of these activities can serve as a valuable baseline for an assessment of the impact of further fishing. \\n(3) The same holds true for the study of the effects of climate change. The area is so far climatologically relatively stable but an increase of bottom-water temperatures is expected during the 21st century (Hellmer et al. 2012). \\n(4) The data can also be used for nature conservation initiatives (Teschke et al. 2013). They are especially suited for such applied ecological comparative studies, since all specimens - with few well-defined exceptions - were sorted from the catches, meaning that not only the presence of the species were registered but also very valuable absence data and the even more informative abundances. In general, the latter data are known to be more sensitive indicators of environmental change than binary presence-absence data.',\n   'pubDate': '2019-03-19',\n   'intellectualRight': 'Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 License',\n   'doi': '10.15468/3pf2mg',\n   'alternateIdentifiers': ['10.15468/3pf2mg',\n    'https://ipt.biodiversity.aq/resource?r=asteroids_and_ophiuroids_from_the_south-eastern_weddell_sea',\n    'a6058a01-5880-41f5-9dbf-3eef8591f714',\n    'http://ipt.biodiversity.aq/resource?r=asteroids_and_ophiuroids_from_the_south-eastern_weddell_sea'],\n   'boundingBox': 'SRID=4326;POLYGON ((-62 -78, -62 -70, -8 -70, -8 -78, -62 -78))',\n   'citation': 'Piepenburg D (2019).

Individuals of the copepod Tigriopus angulatus were collected using fine mesh dip nets from rock pools high on the intertidal zone. Individuals of the flatworm Obrimoposthia ohlini were collected from the undersides of boulders, high in the intertidal zone. The copepod Harpacticus sp. and bivalve Gaimardia trapesina were collected from several macroalgae species at high energy locations in the intertidal zone. Individuals of the sea cucumber Pseudopsolus macquariensis were collected from rocks from high energy locations from the intertidal to subtidal zones. Juveniles of the sea star Anasterias directa were collected from rocks in deep pools, low in the intertidal zone. \\n\\nAll experimental tests using O. ohlini, T. angulatus, P. macquariensis and A. directa were conducted at the AAD Kingston laboratories, while some tests with Harpacticus sp. and all tests with G. trapesina were conducted in the laboratory facilities on Macquarie Island. Adult life-stages were tested for all species except for P. macquairensis and A. directa in which juvenile stages were tested. Psedopsolus macquariensis released eggs in the aquarium which developed into juveniles prior to being used in tests, and juvenile A. directa were collected from the field.\\n\\nEach test involved exposure to copper, zinc or cadmium solution under a static non-renewal test regime over 14 days. Five metal concentrations plus a control were used for each test, with 3-5 replicates of each concentration. Where possible, tests were replicated. Concentrations used in replicate tests sometimes varied, as species sensitivity information accrued in tests was used to optimise subsequent tests. Metal test solutions in seawater were prepared 24 hours prior to the addition of animals, using 500 micrograms/L CuSO4, 500 micrograms/L ZnCl2 and 500 micrograms/L Cd SO4 MilliQ stock solutions. Seawater was filtered to 0.45 microns and water quality parameters were measured using a TPS 90-FL multimeter at the start and end of tests. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was greater than 80% saturation, salinity 35 ppt plus or minus 0.5, and pH was ~8.1-8.3 at the start of tests. All experimental vials and glassware were acid washed with 10% nitric acid and rinsed with MilliQ three times before use. Metal concentrations were determined using ICP-OES; samples of test solutions were taken at the start (day 0) and end of tests (day 14), filtered through a 0.45 microns syringe filter and acidified with 1% ultra-pure nitric acid. Measured concentrations at the start of tests were within 96% of nominal concentrations. In order to estimate exposure concentrations, the measured concentrations at days 0 and 14 were averaged. \\n\\nTests were conducted in lidded plastic vials of varying sizes, depending on the size and number of individuals in the test. For both copepod species, there were 10 individuals per 50 mL in 70 mL vials; for P. macquariensis there were 8 individuals per 50 mL in 70 mL vials; and for O. ohlini, A. directa and G. trapesina, 10 individuals per 100 mL in 120 mL vials. Tests were conducted under a light-dark regime (at 2360 lux) of 18:6h light:dark in summer, 12:12 for tests for the rest of the year. Tests were kept in controlled temperature cabinets set at 6 degrees C, and temperatures within cabinets were monitored throughout the test using data loggers. \\n\\nVials were checked daily and survival recorded on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14. Individuals were considered dead, and removed from test vials, when for G. trapesina adductor muscles no longer closed shell; O. ohlini were inactive and covered in mucous; P. macquariensis and A. directa tube feet were no longer moving; T. angulatus and Harpacticus sp. urosomes were perpendicular to prosomes.\\n\\nData are provided in a series of excel workbooks; one workbook per test species.</p>\\n<p>2018-09-24 - The original datasheet was reformatted to fit IPT Biodiversity.AQ standard.

Sea temperatures surrounding Macquarie Island are relatively stable throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from ~4-7 degrees C (Reynolds and Banzon, 2008). Seawater samples were taken from collection sites of this study and verified as free from metal contamination by analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (Varian 720-ES) (ICP-OES). \\nThe three gastropod species were collected from a range of habitats within the intertidal and subtidal zone (Figure 1). Individuals of Laevilittorina caliginosa were often located in pools high on the intertidal zone, but can occur throughout the intertidal zone. Collections of this species were not specific to any one habitat. Macquariella hamiltoni, endemic to Macquarie Island, was collected from macroalgae in the high energy areas of the subtidal zone. Finally, Cantharidus capillaceus coruscan, was collected from the undersides of boulders in deep tide pools as well as from crevices in the shallow subtidal. This species was also abundant on the floating fronds of Macrocystis pyrifera in deep water which is up to several hundred meters from shore.\\nToxicity tests\\nToxicity tests were conducted at Macquarie Island, over the 2013/14 austral summer, and at the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) in Tasmania, Australia, in 2015. The first round of tests with Laevilittorina caliginosa and Macquariella hamiltoni as well as both tests for Cantharidus capillaceus coruscan were done on Macquarie Island, while the second test for L. caliginosa and M. hamiltoni were done in Australia. Gastropods for use in tests in Australia were transported by ship to the Marine Research Facilities at the AAD where they were housed in purpose-built recirculating aquariums at 6 degrees C for 2 months prior to being used in tests. For tests done at the Macquarie Island laboratory, gastropods were acclimated to laboratory conditions for 2 days prior to their use in tests. \\nTest solutions were prepared 24 hours prior to the addition of animals. All experimental vials and glassware were acid washed with 10% nitric acid and rinsed with MilliQ water three times before use. Five copper concentrations in seawater plus a control were prepared using 500 micrograms/L CuSO4, MilliQ water stock solutions. Seawater was filtered to 0.45 microns and water quality parameters were measured using a TPS 90-FL multimeter at the start and end of tests. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was greater than 80% saturation, salinity was 33-35 ppt, and pH was 8.1-8.3 at the start of tests. Tests were conducted under a light-dark regime (at 2360 lux) of 16:8h light:dark in summer, 12:12 for tests in the rest of the year and were kept in controlled temperature cabinets set at 6 degrees C. Temperatures within cabinets were monitored throughout the test using ibutton data loggers. Water samples of each test concentration were taken at the start (day 0) and end of tests (day 14). Samples were filtered through a 0.45microns Minisart syringe filter and acidified with 1% ultra-pure nitric acid before being analysed by ICP-OES to determine dissolved metal concentrations. Measured concentrations at the start of tests were within 96% of nominal target concentrations. These were averaged with measured concentrations at the end of tests, to estimate exposure concentrations which were then used in the statistical analyses (Table 1). \\nTwo different water renewal regimes were used and tests ran for 7 to 14 d. A static non-renewal test regime was used for L. caliginosa and M. hamiltoni, while water was renewed every second day for tests with C. capillaceus coruscan. Tests were terminated when surviving individuals occurred in less than two concentrations, which occurred sooner (7-10 d) for C. capillaceus coruscan, in both tests. Tests were done in lidded plastic vials of varying sizes, depending on the size and number of individuals in the test. For L. caliginosa and M. hamiltoni, tests were done in 120 mL vials containing 100 mL of seawater with 10 individuals per vial and 5 replicates per concentration. For the larger species, C. capillaceus coruscan, tests were done in 500 mL vials containing 450 mL seawater with 5-6 individuals per vial and 5-6 replicates per concentration. Two tests were run for each species. Concentrations used in replicate tests were not the same, as information on the sensitivity of different species acquired from the first test was used to guide appropriate concentrations in the second test. \\nTwo endpoints were used to determine sensitivity to copper; mortality and sublethal effects. Vials were checked daily and survival and sublethal/behaviour was observed and recorded on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14. For all species, mortality was scored when opercula were open and there was no response to the stimulus the touch of a probe on the operculum. All dead individuals were removed from test vials when observed. At the termination of each test, individuals that had retracted into their shell were placed in clean seawater for 24 hours to determine their ability to recover following exposure to copper.</p>\\n<p>In summary, samples (live marine invertebrates) were collected from Macquarie Island during 11/12, 12/13, 13/14, 14/15 summer seasons and returned to the AAD Kingston Marine Research Facility where they were maintained until use in experimental tests. \\n\\nLaboratory based toxicity tests were conducted on Macquarie Island during 13/14 summer season and at AAD Kingston laboratories between September 2012 and June 2015.\\n\\n2018-09-24 - The original datasheet was reformatted to fit OBIS/GBIF/IPT Biodiversity.AQ standard.

Such annual flights in winter/spring between Cape Leeuwin (Western Australia) and Ceduna (South Australia) have now been conducted over a 23-year period 1993-2016. These surveys have provided evidence of a population trend of around 6% per year, and a current (at 2014) population size of approximately 2300 of what has been regarded as the &#39;western&#39; Australian right whale subpopulation. With estimated population size in the low thousands, it is presumed to be still well below carrying capacity. No trend information is available for the &#39;eastern&#39; subpopulation of animals occurring around the remainder of the southern Australian Coast, to at least as far as Sydney, New South Wales and the populations size is relatively small, probably in the low hundreds. A lower than expected &#39;western&#39; count in 2015 gives weak evidence that the growth rate may be starting to show signs of slowing, though an exponential increase remains the best description of the data.

On the basis of the nucleotide sequence of a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene in each of 72 pure isolates, three major phylogenetic groups were identified, namely the Moraxellaceae/Pseudomonadaceae (29 isolates), the Flavobacteriaceae (14), and the Micrococcaceae (29). Grouping of the isolates on the basis of morpho-physiological tests (whether 49 or 27 parameters) showed similar results to those based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.
